Incremental Learning the Hierarchical Softmax Function for Neural Language Models
========
Train word2vec based on Hierarchical Softmax Function Incrementally. Inspired by Tomas Mikolov article "Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in
Vector Space", [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781v3.pdf).
